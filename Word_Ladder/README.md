#Word Ladder
 
Word ladder is a program that determines how connections a word has with other words in a given textfile.  A connection can be defined as a word that differs from the word in question by a single letter.  For example, cat and cab are connected because they differ by a single letter (t -> b).  This program determines the number of connections a given word has, max number of connections, number of edges, number of direct connections from a given word, as well as the words with the most number of direct connections.  Only 6 letter words are used in this program.

  To run this program use the following commands:

    python3 6Letter.py '[A 6 Letter Word]'
  
  For the word "abased" the following output should be given:
