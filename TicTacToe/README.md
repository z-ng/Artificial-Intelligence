# Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe is a tic tac toe bot that uses BFS to partition moves into good, bad, and nuetral moves.  It then chooses the optimal move, allowing the computer to always win or at least tie against a player.

  To run this program use the following commands:

    python3 ttt.py

  Note that this must be run on windows due to the use of the msvcrt package.
  
  This should produce a result similiar to the one below.
