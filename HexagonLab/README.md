# Hexagons
 
Hexagons is a set of programs that preform various operations on a hexagon/decahedron.

  Decahedron serves to generate a string that represents a dodecahedron with no touching sides with similiar colors.  The colors are represented numerically, and the input takes in the max number of colors allowed.
  Decahedron2 serves to find a given number of non-touching sides
  InclassLab1 and 2 generates a string with no touching sides with similiar colors for different numbered polygons.

  To run decahedron use the following commands:
    
    python3 Decahedron.py '[Max colors]'

  To run decahedron2 use the following commands:
    
    python3 Decahedron2.py '[Number of non-touching sides]'
  
  To run InclassLab1 & 2 use the following commands:

    python3 InclassLab1.py
