# Artificial Intelligence

This repo contains the labs and projects associated with Artificial Intelligence 1 & 2.  Please note that this does not contain all files and programs created during this time period.  All projects completed in this class were written in Python3.  A majority of these files were designated to run on TJ's servers with specific testing programs, and thus it may be difficult to obtain similiar results.  Please also note that not all files were successfully recovered during the annual purge.  This contains the majority of the files but may be missing some of the later files (such as firefly synchronization and additional neural network programs.

## Labs/Projects
