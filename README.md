# Artificial Intelligence

This repo contains the labs and projects associated with Artificial Intelligence 1 & 2.  Please note that this does not contain all files and programs created during this time period.  All projects completed in this class were written in Python3.  A majority of these files were designated to run on TJ's servers with specific testing programs, and thus it may be difficult to obtain similiar results.  Please also note that not all files were successfully recovered during the annual purge.  This contains the majority of the files but may be missing some of the later files (such as firefly synchronization and additional neural network programs.

## Labs/Projects

While not all labs and projects from this class will be available the ones available for viewing will be displayed below.  Highlighted projects will be bolded, with an emphasis on Othello (astericked).  A small description is placed aside each project

  Boggle - boggle game solver to build all possible words from adjacent letters<br/>
  **Cryptogram** - takes in an encrypted message and returns a decrypted message using regex and frequency tables<br/>
  Hexagons - determines the number of colors required to create a n-polygon with no adjacent similiar colors<br/>
  \*\***Othello**\*\* - *othello playing program that incoporates alpha beta pruning, negamax, and various heuristics to optimize moveset*<br/>
  **Railroad** - visualization of a\* algorithm to determine the shortest path between two railroad stations<br/>
  Regex - labs associated with regular expression homework<br/>
  **Slider Puzzle** - implements a\* to find the minimum number of moves required to solve slider puzzle<br/>
  **Sudoku Solver** - given a sudoku puzzle it returns the solution of the sudoku puzzle using a bfs approach<br/>
  Tic-Tac-Toe - a tic-tac-toe playing program that never loses <br/>
  Traveling Salesman - visualization of the traveling salesman problem on various datasets<br/>
  Word Ladder - generates the maximum number of words that are connected to a word that differ by a single letter<br/>
  **XOR Network** - XOR neural network that is used to determine if a random point is within the area contained by the unit circle<br/>
