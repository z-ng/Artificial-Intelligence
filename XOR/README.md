# Unit Circle
 
Unit circle is a program that utilizes a neural network to determine if a point is inside a circle or outside.  This is also known as an XOR problem (exclusive or).  While we can use math to easily determine if a point is inside a circle or not, the unit circle program attempts to train a neural network to recognize whether the point is inside or out.  More information on the XOR problem can be found [here](https://medium.com/@jayeshbahire/the-xor-problem-in-neural-networks-50006411840b). This program will train the neural net using a training data set and run a simulation to determine how accurate the neural network is.

  To run this program use the following command(s):

    python3 Unit_Circle.py
  
  Note numpy must be installed.  This should produce a result similiar to the one below:
