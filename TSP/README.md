# Traveling Salesman Problem
 
The programs contained in this repository seek to solve the traveling salesman problem.  Given a set of data points, the traveling salesman problem seeks to find the shortest possible path that visits all cities.  More information on the traveling salesman problem can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem).  

  To run this program use the following commands:

    python3 travelingSalesman.py
  
The following output should result for KAD:
